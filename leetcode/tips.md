# Main tips from solutions

(1) Check for duplication
- hash map (exact)
- [bucket sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bucket-sort-2/) (within some range)
- cycle detection (?)

(2) Check for missing in 1 to n
- hash map (extra space)
- series sum formulas, then sum diff
- bit manipulation <- harder

(3) Find all ... 
- backtracking & recursion

(4) Sorted (or some order) + find
- sort of binary search


# TODO topics 
- bit manipulation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZusiKXcz_ac <- **must have!**
